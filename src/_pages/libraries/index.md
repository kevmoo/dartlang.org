Dart programs rely on libraries.
Several common libraries are provided for you, such as
`dart:core`, which supports built-in types (numbers, strings, booleans),
collections, date, and time. There are other essential libraries
such as `dart:async` which supports asynchronous programming with classes
like Future and Stream.
