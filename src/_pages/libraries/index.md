Dart programs rely on libraries.

Several common libraries are provided for you, such as
`dart:core` which supports built-in types (numbers, strings, booleans),
collections, date, and time, and `dart:async` which supports
asynchronous programming with classes like Future and Stream.

To learn more about the core libraries, see
[A Tour of the Dart Libraries](library-tour).
If you are developing for the desktop or with the standalone Dart VM,
you might want to bookmark the API reference docs on
[api.dartlang.org](https://api.dartlang.org).
If you are developing for Flutter, bookmark the
[Flutter API docs](http://docs.flutter.io/).

Dart libraries are distributed as _library packages_,
created with the `pub` tool.
For information on installing packages, see
[Install Shared Packages](/tutorials/shared-pkgs).
Learn how to create your own library package with
[Creating Library Packages](create-library-packages).

The Dart community has also contributed many libraries to be shared
with other developers and published on
[pub.dartlang.org](https://pub.dartlang.org/)

Dart applications are also distributed as packages.
