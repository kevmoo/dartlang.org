# Get Started

How do you learn Dart?

This site is the place for learning the Dart language,
APIs, and core libraries.

## DartPad

Use DartPad to play with Dart and to
experience the language and core APIs.
It's a quick and easy way to become familiar with the language features.

You can use the embedded DartPad below, or you can open
[DartPad](https://dartpad.dartlang.org/) in a new tab.

    width="100%"
    height="310px"
    style="border: 1px solid #ccc;">
</iframe>

Note that DartPad does not allow you to import packages,
such as dart:io. If you want that level of control, you'll need
to download an SDK.

## Dive deeper

For a walk through of all of Dart's major language features, see
[A Tour of the Dart Language](/language/language-tour),
also referred to as the "language tour".

To start with sample code, see the [samples](/samples/).

[Effective Dart](/guides/effective-dart/) is a set of guides
that show you how how to write the best Dart code possible.
There are guides on Dart style, documentation, usage, and design.

If you enjoy diving into a formal language specification,
see the [Dart spec](/language/spec).

When you are ready to leverage existing libraries or write your own,
check out Dart's support for [libraries](/libraries/).

## Choose your path

What kind of application do you want to write?

A web app that runs in any modern browser?
: Check out [Dart for the Web](https://webdev.dartlang.org).

A mobile app that runs on **both** iOS and Android from a single codebase?
: Check out [Flutter](https://flutter.io/).

A command line application? A server?
: Check out the [standalone Dart VM](/dart-vm/).

An app to control a thermostat or some other device from the Internet of Things (IoT)?
: Check out [Dartino](https://github.com/dartino).

## Download

Once you're ready to go beyond DartPad, you'll need to download
an SDK and tools for the platform where you want to code.

* For Dart on the desktop (in the browser or at the command line),
  download the [standalone Dart VM](/dart-vm/).
* For Dart on mobile,
  download [Flutter](https://flutter.io/).
* For embedded Dart,
  download [Dartino](https://github.com/dartino).

## Choose your IDE

If you have a favorite IDE, there is probably a Dart plugin for that.
See the tools page for your chosen technology to see what
IDE they recommend, and for tips on how to configure it.
For example, Dart for the Web recommends WebStorm,
and Flutter recommends Atom.

For general IDE advice, see [Tools](/tools).

## Meet your tools

The SDK for each Dart technology provides a set of development tools,
such as a static analyzer, a package manager, and a code formatter.
Refer to the website for your particular technology for a list of
available tools and instructions on how to use them.

## Get help

There are a number of communities and platforms where you can ask,
or answer, Dart related questions. For a list, see
[community](/community/).
