            As of March 2016, there are over 2 million lines of production Dart code at Google. There are hundreds of Google SWEs writing Dart code. Here’s a list of other companies and projects using Dart. The language itself is actively developed and maintained, with XYZ commits to the open source repo, and tens of SWEs working on it full time.

             Our preliminary developer UX research shows that Dart beginners take ~4 days to feel productive in the language (as opposed to ~13 days with JavaScript or ~9 days with C#).

             Our research shows that developers using Dart spend, on average, 12% less than average time on debugging.
