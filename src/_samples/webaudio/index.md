## {{ page.title }}

A port of an example used in the
[Getting Started with Web Audio API](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webaudio/intro/)
article by Boris Smus, originally published on HTML5Rocks.

You can use the Web Audio API for processing and synthesizing audio in web
applications. The API lets you use functionality found in modern game audio
engines and mixing, processing, and filtering tasks found in modern desktop
audio production applications.

You can run the example by running `pub serve` from the `dart-samples/html5`
directory, and then visiting
[localhost:8080/webaudio/intro/](http://localhost:8080/webaudio/intro/).
