Are you writing standalone Dart scripts or server apps?
These pages have the information you need to develop
for the standalone Dart VM.

Once you've gone beyond
[DartPad]({{site.dartlang}}/tools/dartpad),
you will want to [download the SDK](/dart-vm/downloads/).

You'll also want to [meet your tools](tools/).

We have several tutorials you may find helpful.
[Get Started](tutorials/get-started) shows you how
to write a basic Dart script. You may then want to
try out [Write Command-Line Apps](tutorials/cmdline)
tutorial or [Write HTTP Clients & Servers](tutorials/httpserver).

We also have a number of
[articles pertaining to the Dart VM](/dart-vm/articles/).

Finally, check out our code snippets, also known as
[Dart by Example](/dart-vm/dart-by-example/).
