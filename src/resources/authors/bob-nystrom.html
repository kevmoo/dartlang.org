{% capture bio %}
    <p>
      Bob Nystrom is an engineer on the Dart team at Google. Out of a perverse idea of "fun", he created the Magpie programming language. Before becoming a language nerd, he was a game programmer at EA, a user interface designer, and once worked on educational videos about how not to set your house on fire because apparently children can't figure that out on their own without a giant puppet explaining it in poorly rhyming verse.
