How do you learn Dart?

This site is the place for learning the Dart language,
APIs, and core libraries.

## Try simple scripts in DartPad

Use DartPad to play with Dart and to experience the language and core APIs.
It's a quick and easy way to become familiar with the language features.

You can use the embedded DartPad below, or you can open
[DartPad](/tools/dartpad) in a new window.

<iframe
src="{{site.custom.dartpad.embed-dart-prefix}}?horizontalRatio=99&verticalRatio=65"
    width="100%"
    height="310px"
    style="border: 1px solid #ccc;">
</iframe>

Note that DartPad does not allow you to import packages,
such as dart:io. If you want that level of control, you'll need
to install an SDK.

## What kind of app do you want to write?

This website ( www.dartlang.org ) contains information common to most
Dart technologies: the language and core libraries. Where can you
go to learn specific information about your chosen technology?

## Choose your IDE

If you have a favorite IDE, there is probably a Dart plugin for that.
See the tools page for your chosen technology to see what
IDE they recommend, and for tips on how to configure it.
For example, Dart for the Web recommends
[WebStorm]({{site.dart4web}}/tools/webstorm),
and Flutter recommends Atom.

For general IDE advice, see [Tools](/tools).

## Meet your tools

The SDK for each Dart technology provides a set of development tools,
such as a static analyzer, a package manager, and a code formatter.
Refer to the website for your particular technology for a list of
available tools and instructions on how to use them.

The [Tools](/tools) page has more information.

## Get help

There are a number of communities and platforms where you can ask,
or answer, Dart related questions. For a list, see
[community](/community/).
