How do you learn Dart?

This site is the place for learning the Dart language,
APIs, and core libraries.

## Try simple scripts in DartPad

Use DartPad to play with Dart and to experience the language and core APIs.
It's a quick and easy way to become familiar with the language features.

You can use the embedded DartPad below, or you can open
[DartPad](/tools/dartpad) in a new window.

<iframe
src="{{site.custom.dartpad.embed-dart-prefix}}?horizontalRatio=70&verticalRatio=65"
    width="100%"
    height="310px"
    style="border: 1px solid #ccc;">
</iframe>

Note that DartPad does not allow you to import packages,
such as dart:io. If you want functionality from a library,
you'll need to install an SDK.

## What kind of app do you want to write?

This website ( [dartlang.org]({{site.dartlang}}) ) contains information common to most
Dart technologies: the language and core libraries. Where can you
go to learn specific information about your chosen technology?

| | **Web** | **Mobile** | **Embedded** | **Server** |
| **Use case** | Create an app that runs in any modern browser | Create an app from a single codebase that runs on both iOS and Android | Control a device from the Internet of Things (IoT) | Create a command-line app or server |
| **Start here!** | [Install Dart SDK and Dartium](/install/) | [Flutter Setup]({{site.flutter}}/setup/) (in beta) | [Get Started with Dartino]({{site.dartino}}/getting-started/) (in alpha) | [Install Dart SDK](/install/) |

<sup>*</sup>If you have a favorite IDE, there is probably a Dart plugin for that.
See the link for tips on how to configure the recommended IDE.
For general IDE advice, see [Tools](/tools).

The [Tools](/tools) page has more information.
