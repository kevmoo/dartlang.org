favicons missing on dart4webo


twitter cards: logic in the layout template, if it's an article, include this info, etc

Tom can swap out the icon

bundle exec htmlproofer ./publish --disable-external
bundle exec htmlproofer ./publish --assume-extension --directory-index-file
  check for valid HTML - they run it as part of the deployment process
    run this before pushing a commit
    find a way to ignore extensions "pretty URLs", "clean URLs" (Firebase),
    "extensionless URLs".
    configuration that allows it: he will set it up as a configuration within the repo


collections
  makes a faster build time,
  less logic to maintain
  standard jekyll optimization


Tom:
- he's pretty much done with dartlang
- he's not doing anything until he gets the word, loud and clear, of Firebase or whatever
- he's not fixing any of the styling that Filip did


Kevin:
  - Firebase can handle redirects, but do we need a plugin? Tom?
  - create a spreadsheet -
    they can Filip creates a tool to parse the csv (google spreadsheets)
  - Does firebase support staging???  (Tom? Filip?)
    1) Confirm we have a path for a google-managed firebase host
    2) Confirm that we can stage and play with it

- Ask Tom to merge dartlang style changes to dart4web.
- Filip is willing to move jquery and javascript to Dart.
  - Would make a good content article and good code to share
  - he wants to use the make file
- FRONT PAGE
  Filip has asked Tom to implement the top of the home page
